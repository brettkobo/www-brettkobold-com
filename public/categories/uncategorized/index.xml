      <description>Recently I went camping in Los Angeles and found it difficult to plan all the coordination, especially dealing with the purchasing of an Adventure Pass. Currently this is the website that provides a list of where you can purchase one. Well, I was not too impressed with just a list of vendors that I had to search and sift through. So I built a quick web scraper, geocoded each of the address and plotted them on an interactive map.</description>

      <description>There are a few packages in R that I wish I was exposed to earlier, if I had an understanding of these packages earlier I would have been on Stack Overflow less. These are some of the most common packages that I use.
 tidyverse #hadlyverse dplyr #grouping tidyr #reshaping ggplot2 #plotting magrittr #pipefowarding lubridate #dates stringr #strings tidytext #moreStrings This list will continue to grow as I think of more packages.</description>
