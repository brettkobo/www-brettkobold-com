      <description>Almost every day I am looking at data either for my job or personal development. A lot of the time I am looking at data that is describing something like TSA claims or the metallurgy of bicycles. As an analyst, I am always trying to synthesize stories from data to help bring insight to my team. Now I am starting to look at my habits and figure out how I can synthesize stories about myself.</description>

      <description>As an avid cyclist and bicycle mechanic, I have always taken a keen interest in how bicycles have evolved with technology. From the original modified “klunker” mountain bikes to the carbon fiber electronic shifting road bikes, bikes have come a long way and will continue to advance. We can look at this change in technology and start to see the shifts in the industry by observing the historical archives.
Let explore some of the long-debated questions that keep popping up on bicycle message boards and talked about on those weekend rides with your dentist on his $6000 Pinarello.</description>

      <description>As I continue on my journey as an analyst, I keep running across interesting datasets. Over the last few weeks, I have been interested in various datasets around flying. So far I have found TSA claims from the past fifteen years and the number of passengers that have flown in the United States. Starting with the TSA claims, I wanted to see if I could find anything interesting.
First I wanted to acknowledge that it was a bit of challenge to collect and clean this data.</description>

      <title>What 9 Million Parking Tickets Says About Los Angeles</title>

      <description>Over the last 4 years the Los Angeles Department of Transportation has given out 655 million dollars worth of parking tickets. As a resident of Southern California, I am all too familiar with walking out to my car after running inside real quick to grab my hat and finding that dreaded sun-faded white and yellow carbon paper on my windshield. All over Los Angeles, this is happening at an astonishing rate, on average 7000 cars are being written up every day.</description>

      <title>10 Years of Color – Analysis on my Personal Photo Collection</title>

      <description>Following a similar trend to the analysis of Van Gogh’s painting I did, I wanted to explore my own personal photo history. Photography has been such a large part of my life the last 10 years, in fact I have managed to take about 15,000 photos. I would have never guessed I was taking so many photos. Photos can show so much about your life, and it is so strange to think that I pretty much have my life well-documented since middle school, well at least well documented with a digital camera.</description>

      <title>How to “Hack” Psychology Internships</title>

      <description>This project started because my wife will eventually need to find an internship in order to graduate from grad school. As she told me more about the process, it sounded like a headache. There are more psych students than there are psych internships. Knowing this I wanted to give her as much of a competitive edge as I could. So instead of relying on APPIC and her school to help her find one, I decided to use my knowledge to help figure it out.</description>

      <description>I set out to understand the life of a man through the colors he chose to use. Vincent van Gogh was an amazing painter who changed the art world more then he will ever know.
 What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything? – Vincent van Gogh
 As Vincent declared I wanted to have the courage to keep exploring data and discover the meaning behind it.</description>

      <description>This American Life does an amazing job at telling stories about everyday people. As an avid listener I have come to love the journeys that Ira Glass &amp;amp; his producers are able to take me through. I have been using TAL’s website for the last several years and I wanted to try and provide a new way to interact with it. Below is two ways that provides a new way to interact and listen to the podcast of This American Life.</description>
