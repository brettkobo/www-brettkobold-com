  One of my favorite R libraries is the plumber, having the abibilty to quickly turn any of my R code into an API allows for anyone use my functions or data. Wanting to explore some use cases in the digital analytics relm for. One thing I have always been interested in was when a blog would show a trendline or spark line of an article. It is nice to see an organization being a transparent with some of the data they are collecting.

  Recent I moved across the United States with my wife and dog. Previously I lived in Pasadena, CA and now I am in South Bend, IN. After doing alot of packing and coordinatoring large cubes shippments we were off from California to Indiana. I was wanting to do something with data and collection for the drive across. So in my phone I set up a Tasker app to record a file of alot of different variables that phones collect.

  <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 21, 2017</span>
  Recently I went camping in Los Angeles and found it difficult to plan all the coordination, especially dealing with the purchasing of an Adventure Pass. Currently this is the website that provides a list of where you can purchase one. Well, I was not too impressed with just a list of vendors that I had to search and sift through. So I built a quick web scraper, geocoded each of the address and plotted them on an interactive map.

  Almost every day I am looking at data either for my job or personal development. A lot of the time I am looking at data that is describing something like TSA claims or the metallurgy of bicycles. As an analyst, I am always trying to synthesize stories from data to help bring insight to my team. Now I am starting to look at my habits and figure out how I can synthesize stories about myself.

  <span class="post-date">Thu, May 18, 2017</span>
  There are a few packages in R that I wish I was exposed to earlier, if I had an understanding of these packages earlier I would have been on Stack Overflow less. These are some of the most common packages that I use.
 tidyverse #hadlyverse dplyr #grouping tidyr #reshaping ggplot2 #plotting magrittr #pipefowarding lubridate #dates stringr #strings tidytext #moreStrings This list will continue to grow as I think of more packages.

  </h1>
  <span class="post-date">Mon, May 8, 2017</span>
  As an avid cyclist and bicycle mechanic, I have always taken a keen interest in how bicycles have evolved with technology. From the original modified “klunker” mountain bikes to the carbon fiber electronic shifting road bikes, bikes have come a long way and will continue to advance. We can look at this change in technology and start to see the shifts in the industry by observing the historical archives.
Let explore some of the long-debated questions that keep popping up on bicycle message boards and talked about on those weekend rides with your dentist on his $6000 Pinarello.

  <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 29, 2017</span>
  As I continue on my journey as an analyst, I keep running across interesting datasets. Over the last few weeks, I have been interested in various datasets around flying. So far I have found TSA claims from the past fifteen years and the number of passengers that have flown in the United States. Starting with the TSA claims, I wanted to see if I could find anything interesting.
First I wanted to acknowledge that it was a bit of challenge to collect and clean this data.

  YA. I have been commuting through downtown LA for the last 6 months and have noticed some strange phenomenon over the weeks. Consistently I have found some days worse than others. Google Maps is one of my favorite applications and if I had to give up every app but one, I would save Google Maps. This application has allowed for me to explore all over Los Angeles and is the reason I was able to safely navigate the California coast on my bike tour several summers ago.

  </h1>
  <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 4, 2016</span>
  Over the last 4 years the Los Angeles Department of Transportation has given out 655 million dollars worth of parking tickets. As a resident of Southern California, I am all too familiar with walking out to my car after running inside real quick to grab my hat and finding that dreaded sun-faded white and yellow carbon paper on my windshield. All over Los Angeles, this is happening at an astonishing rate, on average 7000 cars are being written up every day.

  </h1>
  <span class="post-date">Mon, Sep 5, 2016</span>
  Following a similar trend to the analysis of Van Gogh’s painting I did, I wanted to explore my own personal photo history. Photography has been such a large part of my life the last 10 years, in fact I have managed to take about 15,000 photos. I would have never guessed I was taking so many photos. Photos can show so much about your life, and it is so strange to think that I pretty much have my life well-documented since middle school, well at least well documented with a digital camera.

  </h1>
  <span class="post-date">Wed, Aug 31, 2016</span>
  This project started because my wife will eventually need to find an internship in order to graduate from grad school. As she told me more about the process, it sounded like a headache. There are more psych students than there are psych internships. Knowing this I wanted to give her as much of a competitive edge as I could. So instead of relying on APPIC and her school to help her find one, I decided to use my knowledge to help figure it out.

  We all know pixel implementations range from being simple such as putting an image tag on a page to a complex function that dynamically takes apart your order and creates individual pixels for each of the items in your cart. Whether you are just a simple pixel pusher or an actual developer who works with tag management systems, you might find this tutorial helpful.
Google Tag Manager is a great system to help create pixels because it allows for data to be easily appended onto the pixel.

 What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything? – Vincent van Gogh
 As Vincent declared I wanted to have the courage to keep exploring data and discover the meaning behind it.

  <span class="post-date">Fri, Apr 17, 2015</span>
  One of the biggest questions in web analytics right now is “How do we know users are reading or looking at our content?” In the past, Liferay has used “page views” and “number of clicks” to determine the popularity of our content, but we’re now learning that these methods do not necessarily determine the success of a page. Page views show how users are navigating through your site, but they will not provide the strongest insight about what they are truly interested in.
