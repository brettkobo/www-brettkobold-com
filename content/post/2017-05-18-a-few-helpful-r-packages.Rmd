There are a few packages in R that I wish I was exposed to earlier, if I had an understanding of these packages earlier I would have been on Stack Overflow less. These are some of the most common packages that I use.

  * [tidyverse][1] #hadlyverse
  * [dplyr][2] #grouping
  * [tidyr][3] #reshaping
  * [ggplot2][4] #plotting
  * [magrittr][5] #pipefowarding
  * [lubridate][6] #dates
  * [stringr][7] #strings 
  * [tidytext][8] #moreStrings
  
This list will continue to grow as I think of more packages.
