<p>In early February 2019 I was promoted and put in charge of our Marketing Analytics Team at Workfront. Though it has been an exciting new challenge, it has come with a cost. Before the promotion, I was averaging about 10 hour per week in meetings. After the promotion, that average went up to 20 hour! In order to understand how I am spending my time the last year, I pulled all my Google Calendar data from the API and built this visualization.</p>

<p>The amount of time I am spending in meetings is only increasing! Even though this is a natural thing to occur with a promotion to a team manager, I want to continue to monitor this and make sure I am not spending all of my time in meetings and still have time to work on individual projects. We will see how the next year turns out. Here is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/brettkobo/bc48819d3839f99e09152f5032aca82a">code</a> if you want to create your own.</p>
