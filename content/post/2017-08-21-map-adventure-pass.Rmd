Recently I went camping in Los Angeles and found it difficult to plan all the coordination, especially dealing with the purchasing of an Adventure Pass. Currently this is the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/r5/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=stelprdb5181410"  target="_blank">website</a> that provides a list of where you can purchase one. Well, I was not too impressed with just a list of vendors that I had to search and sift through. So I built a quick web scraper, geocoded each of the address and plotted them on an interactive map. 

Below you will see everywhere you are currently able to purchase an Adventure Pass with the address, phone number, and the type of pass that is available for purchase. This map was updated on August 20th, 2017, its accuracy is only as good as the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov" target="_blank">www.fs.usda.gov</a> website.
